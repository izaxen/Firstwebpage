<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>This is my initialy first single handed coded webpage.</p>
<p>The graphic has way more to offer for the graphic talented people. But it is my own work and I will add more details
  to it as the education continues.
  Eventually the site will get better as I will implent more knowledge in it and use different techniques.
</p>
<p>Without any practice you wonÂ´t learn anything and there is a saying:<br>
  If you always do a thing the same way you will always get the same result or worse.
